# PokedexApp



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.5.

## Development server

1. Create the new folder "pokemon" on your computer.
2. Clone or download project from Git hub in "pokemon" folder.
3. Open CMD.
4. In CMD  you should get to the ".../pokemon/pokemon-main".
    ...for example:  C:\>cd pokemon
                     
                     C:\pokemon>cd pokemon-main
                     
5. Then you should check a version of NODE.JS :
                     C:\pokemon\pokemon-main>node -v (Angular require 10. upper version. It was built on v15.5.1 NODE).
                     
6. Run command :    C:\pokemon\pokemon-main>npm install  (npm will install all dependencies on the project).
7. Run command :    C:\pokemon\pokemon-main>ng serve     (npm will generate the project).  

8. After compiling  Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/  
                                                                                                           


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
